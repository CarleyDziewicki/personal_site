I am currently a full-time student working towards my Masters Degree in Data Science and Analytics at Grand Valley State University. My bachlors is in Mathematics from Kalamazoo College with a minor in Environmental Science. 

Within the realm of data science and analytics I am looking for a career that will provide opportunites to be creative within the analytics process. I like projects that have technical and creative elements, such as building this website. I am also very passionate about the environment and specifically food systems, and ways in which we can change our diet for our health but also our community and planet.

I have included my resume below. 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
skills<- c("R", "Tableau", "Excel", "MS Access", "Java")
values<- c(10, 6, 8, 8, 4)

df<- data.frame(skills,values)

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

df %>% ggplot(aes(y = values, x = skills)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip() + theme_classic() + theme(axis.ticks=element_blank(),axis.line=element_blank(),axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.title.y=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank()) + labs(title = "Skill Level")

```
